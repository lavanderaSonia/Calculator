## Decisions
Here I will explain the decisions that I took in terms of code.
1. I decided to use a string variable (keysPressed) to save special characters such as negative numbers and decimals so that I could manage them more easily. Then I use a function to parse this string and save all the numbers and operators in an array of length 3 to operate with them. In this case I use a useRef to save the keys that the user types and donÂ´t cause a re-render when operate with them. 
2. I decided to use a useState to save the full operation (operation) and its solution (solution) to keep the state of the calculator and trigger re-render when update the state and reflect it in the display.
